Our Pet Care application our team has several ethical and privacy issues that we
need to take into consideration. While the main point of our data that our application will need to
operate will be in the form of their pet’s information pets are still valued members of families.
Alongside basic pet information, users will have the opportunity to set up and record medical
records of their pet which means possible records of the veterinarian who provides for the pet
which will need to be protected. Naturally, our app will also need to be responsible for the
protection of basic user information and just their pet’s details. These protections will come
through with the form of following industry practices of security and ensuring security can be
built throughout the entire process of software development. Fortunately for our team due to the
nature of application we aren’t as vulnerable to user discrimination and exploitation. Generally
pets are never considered to be aspects of a person’s lifestyle that is generally exploitable but still
important and valued nonetheless
