With our pet care, we are considering security pet profiles to be a major point of security.
Pet profile databases contain information regarding pet names, ages, breeds, etc and are going to
become the center point of our application. In regards to our databases, our team will need to be
promptly aware of potential SQL injections that could possibly infect and destroy or even sell the
userâ€™s data. Throughout development of our pet care application this will become a primary
focus throughout the entirety of development. Security as an issue is best solved when the whole
team can work and prioritize as development continues instead of at the end of the development.
Once again, if our social media features are able to come into fruition, social media protections,
both for our team and the user, will need to be managed and secured as well.
