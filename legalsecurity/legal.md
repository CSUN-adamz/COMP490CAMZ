Our team also has taken into consideration many legal issues that need to be addressed in
order to operate a successful application. First and foremost our team needs to ensure the proper
licensing agreements with APIs, libraries, and frameworks. Additionally, due to the fact that we
are allowing users to upload photos of their pets alongside medical records we need to consider
security a priority due to potential legal liability that may befall our team. Furthermore, if our
team finds development to be running smoothly and goals are being met promptly we may
implement further social media integration that needs to be handled properly. For this, we need
to ensure we are integrating certain social media apps properly and that data isnâ€™t susceptible to
outside hackers who would try to steal that information.
