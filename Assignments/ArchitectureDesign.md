Our Pet Care Application Model
* We plan to develop in Java, and accessing/creating our own databases for pet information possibly using Thymeleaf
* We will plan to APIs to inegrate both the Map function and allow for more interactive Calendar functionality!

(Google Calenders, Google Maps API depends on pricing availabilty)

* Our team has developed our first batch of architecture Design Prototypes!
  - We've focused on the UI's accesbility, people who would want to use a pet care app need it simple!
  - We've made our first prototype of the UI

* We have also developed our beta set of Use Cases, with provided images. (As well as the flow diagram from the previous assingment)

* Controls: UserControls, PetControls, FeedingControls.
   - Users: Login, Logout, Register
   - Pets: AddPet, RemovePet, EditPet
   - FeedingSchedule: FeedingSchdule, EditSchedule, ViewSchedule, AlertsSchedule


We've our ready to spend this week working on and familarizing ourselves with possible use cases. Our team is using different diagramming appliations such as LucidChart for our visuals
